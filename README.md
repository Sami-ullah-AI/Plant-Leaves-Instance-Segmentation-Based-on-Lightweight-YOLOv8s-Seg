# Plant-Leaves-Instance-Segmentation-Based-on-Lightweight-YOLOv8s-Seg
Our research is anchored in the utilization of the YOLOv8s-Seg model for advancing plant leaves instance segmentation. Originating from the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, YOLOv8 serves as a deep-learning model renowned for object detection, developed by the same authors as YOLOv5. YOLOv8 builds upon the YOLOv5 network, introducing significant improvements and optimizations that enhance algorithmic performance. The versatility of YOLOv8 extends beyond object detection and tracking, encompassing tasks like instance segmentation, image classification, and key point detection. Similar to YOLOv5, YOLOv8 offers models at five different scales (n, s, m, l, x), with increasing depth and width.
