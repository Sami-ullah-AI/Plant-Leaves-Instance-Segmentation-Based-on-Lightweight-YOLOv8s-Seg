# Plant-Leaves-Instance-Segmentation-Based-on-Lightweight-YOLOv8s-Seg
The primary emphasis of our research is to develop a high-performance model tailored for deployment on edge devices, particularly mobile applications. Our focal point revolves around achieving a delicate balance between model accuracy and efficiency, ensuring swift disease detection on plant leaves. The key aspects of our research focus can be categorized as follows:
•	We center our research on optimizing the YOLOv8 model for lightweight deployment, utilizing TensorRT to balance efficiency and accuracy on edge devices. The resulting YOLOv8seg.pt model embodies our commitment to swift disease detection.
•	Our research includes a comprehensive comparison of our lightweight YOLOv8 model with the baseline YOLOv8, YOLOv5, and YOLOv3. Evaluation metrics will illuminate trade-offs, providing insights into model size, speed, and accuracy.
•	Beyond disease detection, our model integrates seamlessly with a recommendation system. By leveraging detected diseases, farmers receive targeted treatment recommendations, empowering them with actionable insights for effective crop management.
•	Our dataset encompasses diverse plant species, enhancing the model's adaptability. Annotation using Roboflow ensures meticulous detailing for precise disease segmentation and classification, contributing to the model's overall performance.
•	The lightweight YOLOv8 model's dual focus on running on edge devices and maintaining efficiency is pivotal. Striking a balance ensures real-time disease detection without compromising the model's feasibility for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
